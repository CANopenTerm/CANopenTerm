You work in an R&D environment and are responsible for the development
or testing of CANopen devices? Or you are an application engineer and
need a practical tool to communicate within a CANopen network?

Then CANopenTerm is exactly the right tool for you, because it was
developed for exactly this purpose.  CANopenTerm is a versatile software
tool to analyse and configure CANopen devices.  It is an interactive
terminal that communicates via external CAN hardware on the CAN-Bus.  In
addition to an integrated help for each command, a Lua API is also
available, which can be used to automate recurring tasks, such as
writing and reading an EDS, generating traffic, etc.

## Features

- Read and write expedided Service Data Objects (SDO).

- Send Network management (NMT) commands.

- Simulate asynchronous Process Data Objects (PDO) for testing.

- Automate your workflow by writing Scripts in [Lua
  5.4](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/).

- Optional graphical user interface.

- Can be used without limitations under Windows as well on Linux.
