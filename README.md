## Overview

CANopenTerm is an open-source tool for developing, testing,
and analyzing **CANopen** CC networks and devices. It provides
a technical, no-nonsense solution for professionals working
with CAN CC-based networks. Additionally, it supports
**SAE J1939** and **OBD-II** protocols, making it versatile
for various applications.

Key functionalities include:

- **Monitoring and Analysis**:
  Advanced trace filtering and node access for comprehensive
  network monitoring and analysis.

- **Configuration and Simulation**:
  Tools for configuring CANopen CC devices and simulating nodes
  in development.

- **Testing**:
  Capabilities to thoroughly test CANopen CC networks and devices.

- **Extended Protocol Support**:
  Features tailored for CANopen, SAE J1939, and OBD-II protocols.

## Key Features

- **Read and Write SDOs**:
  Manage Service Data Objects with a user-friendly interface.

- **Send NMT Messages**:
  Control network management with commands to one or all nodes.

- **Simulate PDOs**:
  Add asynchronous Process Data Objects to simulate network
  traffic.

- **Versatile Raw CAN CC Interface**:
  For non-CANopen needs, offering flexibility and control.

- **Workflow Automation**:
  Streamline workflows with built-in
  [Lua](https://canopenterm.de/lua-api) and
  [Python](https://canopenterm.de/python-api) interpreters,
  offering similar APIs for flexible task automation.

## Additional Features

- **Built-in DBC Parser**:
  Import and utilize
  [DBC files](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-dbc-file-database-intro)
  for efficient CAN CC network analysis.

- **CANopen Profiles**:
  Includes several common application and device profiles in a well-documented
  [JSON-based file format](https://canopenterm.de/codb2json?id=file-format-specification).

- **Conformance Testing**:
  Verify the object dictionary of your CANopen CC devices with the built-in
  electronic data sheet (EDS) parser.

- **Test Report Generation**:
  Generate Test reports for integration with continuous integration (CI) systems
  such as [Jenkins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit/).

- **Grahical Widgets**:
  Intuitive graphical widgets for real-time CAN data visualisation.

## Why Your Support Matters

**CANopenTerm** is developed to provide a powerful tool for
professionals at no cost.  However, maintaining and improving
such a project requires resources.  Your donations can make a
significant difference, enabling continued development and support.
