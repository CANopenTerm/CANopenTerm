You work in an R&D environment and are responsible for the development
or testing of CANopen devices? Or you are an application engineer and
you need a simple tool to communicate easily and efficiently on a
CANopen network?

The you have come to the right place!

CANopenTerm is a versatile, albeit simple to use, software tool for
analysing and testing CANopen networks and devices with the aid of an
interactive terminal.  In addition to reading and writing expedited
**Service Data Objects** (SDO) and sending **Network Management**
commands (NMT), it is also possible to simulate asynchronous **Process
Data Objects (PDO)**.  Complex, recurring tasks can be automated with
the help of scripts written in [Lua
5.4](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/) and a custom API.

In addition, CANopenTerm is entirely free and has been released under
the terms of a permissive open source license.

## Features

- Read and write expedided Service Data Objects (SDO).

- Send Network management (NMT) commands.

- Simulate asynchronous Process Data Objects (PDO) for testing.

- Automate your workflow by writing Scripts in [Lua
  5.4](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/).

- Optional graphical user interface.

- Can be used without limitations under Windows as well on Linux.
