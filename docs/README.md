## Description

Do you work in an R&D environment and are responsible for the
development or testing of CANopen devices? You are an application
engineer in need of a simple tool to communicate easily and efficiently
on a CANopen network?

Then you have come to the right place!

CANopenTerm is a versatile, yet simple to use, software tool for
analysing and testing CANopen networks and devices with the aid of an
interactive terminal.  In addition to reading and writing expedited
**Service Data Objects** (**SDO**) and sending **Network Management**
commands (**NMT**), it is also possible to simulate asynchronous
**Process Data Objects** (**PDO**).  Complex, recurring tasks can be
automated with the help of scripts written in [Lua
5.4](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/) and a custom API.

In addition, CANopenTerm is entirely free and has been released under
the terms of a permissive open source license.

## Features

- Read and write expedided Service Data Objects (SDO).

- Send Network management (NMT) commands.

- Simulate asynchronous Process Data Objects (PDO) for testing.

- Automate your workflow by writing Scripts in [Lua
  5.4](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/).

- Optional graphical user interface.

- Can be used without limitations under Windows as well on Linux.
